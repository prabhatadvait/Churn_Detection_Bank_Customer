# 🏦 **Churn Detection for Bank Customers** 🌟

This project focuses on predicting **customer churn** in the banking sector using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** built from scratch. By leveraging historical customer data, the model identifies patterns that help predict whether a customer is likely to leave the bank or remain loyal. Built using **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and a rich ecosystem of Python libraries, this project demonstrates the power of deep learning for solving business-critical problems.

## 🌟 **Project Aim**

The aim of this project is to develop an **ANN-based churn detection system** that predicts whether a customer will leave the bank based on their historical interactions and demographic features. This system enables banks to:  
- 📊 Analyze customer behavior patterns.  
- 🏦 Proactively address customer concerns.  
- 💡 Implement retention strategies for at-risk customers.
